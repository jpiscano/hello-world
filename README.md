# hello-world
this is a sample repository built during the hello-world tutorial
My name is Jim and I am going through the GitHub tutorial
This is pretty cool!!!!
It seems to work from VS Code now.
Ok, the changes were sent up from VS Studio and it prompted me to login to GitHub.com
Very nice!
It seems to be working really well.  It is showing my changes in VS studio editor.
Then I can stage and push my changes.
